# The Impact of Government Expenditure on Economic Growth in Uganda (1986–2021)

## Overview
This repository contains the empirical analysis for my Bachelor’s thesis, which examines the relationship between government expenditure and economic growth in Uganda over the period 1986–2021. The study applies modern time-series econometric techniques to investigate both short-run and long-run dynamics between fiscal policy and economic performance.
The project emphasizes rigorous econometric methodology, diagnostic testing, and careful interpretation of results in a developing-country context.

## Academic Context
**Degree:** BSc Economics and Statistics  
**Institution:** Kyambogo University  
**Project Type:** Bachelor’s Thesis  
---
## Research Objective
To investigate whether government expenditure and its components have a statistically significant impact on economic growth in Uganda, and to distinguish between short-run and long-run effects.
---
## Data

- **Country:** Uganda  
- **Period:** 1986–2021  
- **Frequency:** Annual  
- **Data sources:**  
  - Government expenditure data (public finance statistics)  
  - Macroeconomic indicators (national accounts)
---
## Key Variables

### Dependent Variable
- **Economic growth** (GDP growth or real GDP)

### Independent Variables
- Total government expenditure
- Components of government expenditure (e.g., recurrent and development spending)
- Control macroeconomic variables (where applicable)
---
## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Trend analysis of government expenditure and economic growth
- Descriptive statistics
- Time-series visualization
---
### Time-Series Econometric Analysis
The following econometric techniques were applied:

- **Stationarity tests**
  - Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF)
  - Phillips–Perron (PP)
- **Cointegration analysis**
  - Long-run equilibrium relationships
- **Error Correction Model (ECM)**
  - Short-run dynamics and speed of adjustment
- **Granger causality tests**
  - Direction of causality between government expenditure and economic growth
---
## Model Diagnostics
- Stationarity verification
- Residual diagnostics
- Stability of estimated relationships
- Interpretation of short-run vs long-run coefficients
---
## Key Findings
*(Detailed results and interpretation are provided in the thesis document.)*
---
## Limitations
- Annual data limits high-frequency dynamics.
- Results are specific to Uganda’s institutional and macroeconomic context.
- Findings should be interpreted as associations rather than structural causal effects.
---
## Tools & Software
- Econometric software (e.g., EViews / Stata / R / Python)
- Time-series econometric methods
- Statistical testing frameworks
